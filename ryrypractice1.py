# An apple company is having trouble keeping track of how many apples theyâ€™re growing and how many apples they are selling,
# and want to know their total profit for each month. Each week, once a week, they get a total count from their harvesters
# on how many apples were harvested for that week. They also get data on how many apples they sell each day, with Thursday
# being the day they sell apples for half off.

# You tell them you can write a function that takes m months apples harvested as an array, where the array contains 4
# entrees for the total apples harvested a month, and n total apples sold each day for a given 30 day month as an array
# (30 entrees in the array, one for each day). If they normally sell apples for $2.50, and it takes $.30 for them to
# harvest an apple. Determine their monthly profits given that the Thursday of each week is a half off day. you can
# assume they sell no apples on saturday and sunday as they are closed.

# m = 4 entrees, each entry is for the total num of apples harvested each week
# n = array - containing apples sold each day of m

#default the array to 30
